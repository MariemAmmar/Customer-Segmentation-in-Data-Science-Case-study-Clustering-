# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
This is a Python code that performs customer segmentation using K-means clustering. The goal of customer segmentation is to divide a customer base into groups of individuals that share similar characteristics. This can be useful for identifying customer needs, behavior, and preferences.

The code uses the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers based on their satisfaction and loyalty scores. It also uses the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) metric to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Dependencies
This code requires the following Python libraries to be installed:

* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn

## Data
The data used in this code is located in Marketing_segmentation.csv. It contains the satisfaction and loyalty scores of 30 customers.

## Usage
To run the code, open customer_segmentation.py and run it in a Python environment. The code will perform customer segmentation and display the results in the console and in several plots.

## Output
The code outputs the following:

* A scatter plot of the satisfaction and loyalty scores
* A scatter plot of the clustered data
* A plot of the WCSS for different numbers of clusters
* A scatter plot of the clustered data with the optimal number of clusters
